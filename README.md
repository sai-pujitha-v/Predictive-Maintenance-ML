# Predictive-Maintenance-ML
This project is a predictive analytics engine designed for industrial manufacturing. By analyzing historical log files and real-time vibration datasets, the software uses machine learning to identify "mechanical stress signatures." This allows factory managers to predict equipment failure weeks in advance, cost-saving maintenance strategy.
